excess volume vs yesterday at the same time / you want some intraday volume profile
svd and clustering bien sur
ce serait bien d'avoir un excel avec le secteur de chaque coin



- The very first strategy should simply perform a KMeans 
- The second one should perform a SVD

- the third ones will be pairs based

- we will need a detailled fondamental mapping of tokens


## Clustering
OPTICS or Kmeans

## Graph Neural Networks  GNN

N-Beats must be trained on real life timeseries and fine tuned on financial data
 using pretrained N-BEATS on M4 series.
